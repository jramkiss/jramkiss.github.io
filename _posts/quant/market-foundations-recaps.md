Questions

- Yield-to-maturity is just interest rate calculated by discounting the price? 
- Yield curve is price VS YtM?
- Prices and yields move in opposite directions because yields are calcualted based on price?


#### Questions: 

- What does downward sloping yield curve mean for the economy?
- Does a steep yield curve mean that investors have a strong opinion on what the future of interest rates will look like? 
- Does it only make sense to talk about duration for portfolios with cash flows?
- How to attribute the princopal componenets to level, slope, curve?
- Can we have a Bayesian model / error bars when estimating the spot curve?



### Day 1 Recap

- Topics covered: treasury debt, yield curve, spot curves and discount rates
- Key learnings: How to calculate discount rates and interpret yield curves 
- Trader/partner talk: Larry W on Treasury debt and Repo. I did not find this talk particularly interesting. He described Treasury debt and repo as the plumping of financial markets, so from that perspective it is important to understand.


### Day 2 Recap

- Topics covered: interest rate risk, duration, convexity, duration risk
- Key learnings: what is duration and why is it necessary. What does duration measure and not measure. Why is convexity needed. More on different yield curves
  - For 2 bonds with the same maturity but one has a higher coupon rate: higher duration and higher convexity. This is because duration and convexity are weighted averages of the discounted cash flows.
  - Either long maturities or low coupons will create high sensitvities to interest rates
- Trader/partner talk: Money, the Fed and banking. How rates are set, what the role of the Fed is. Also talked about the SVB duration risk problem which ultimately lead to its shortfall. This talk gave good context into the role of the Fed. It tied in well to the day's learnings with real life examples of the dangers of duration risk


### Day 3 Recap:
- Topics covered: interest rate swaps, duration on swaps, negative swap spreads, repo agreements, SOFR rates, 
- Key learnings: What is the need for floating rate bonds and why is it such a big market. Why swaps are attractive
  - Swaps essentially transfer duration for "free", since we don't use any of our balance sheet to enter the swap
  - The fixed side of a swap has all the duration and the floating side has duration equal to the frequency of coupon payments
- Trader talk: Macro and relative value fixed income trading. I found this talk quite avdanced. It required a good mental map of macroeconomics and different yield curves. Also used a lot of finance lingo which was hard to unpack in real time. We reviewed some potential trades made by this desk and did a group exercise to determine an interest rate futures trade based on some macro data


### Day 4 Recap: 
- Topics covered: forward rates, 
- Key learnings: 
- Trader talk: Impact of Fed decision in the market, FICC trading. This talk was great, but was also quite difficult to follow exactly because of the jargon. He walked through the Fed's decision process w.r.t. inflation before, during and after COVID and how the market expectation different (at certain points) to Fed decisions. Also spoke about different realized VS implied vol trades that they do. I spoke to him after to get a better sense of how their desk works. He mentioned different models for different regimes, but the regimes they look at will be difficult to model. Eg: Russia invation, Rep. elected, 9/11, etc. The monitor headlines, but with a different usecase to Jarvis.
  - Why implied vol decreases with quantitative easing: In QE we are usually in a lower rate environment
