## December 1st, 2023:

- Fed rate cuts: Federal Reserve not ready to start talking about interest rate cuts. Powell says they don’t want to get caught in a situation like 2021 where the inflation data is fleeting. Another FOMC chair suggests that rates can come down if inflation behaves for a few months (which affected the value of the US dollar). Market pricing rate cuts to come around may
- Corn prices falling: $4.5/bushel at the moment due to an increase in supply from the US and Brazil, which is helping price inflation. US farmers have expanded their corn farms last year after demand surges, which have expanded supply. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine also sent wheat and grain prices soaring, while droughts in South America from El Niño affected supply. In response to these rising prices, demand slipped. Ukraine has also resumed exports from its Black Sea ports. This is likely contributing in some way to lower CPI, but not as a direct consequence of interest rates.

## November 19th, 2023:

- Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) hack:
  - What happened: Clearing house of ICBC that manages US Treasuries was hacked, causing traders routing orders through them to not know what positions were closed / open 
  - Impact on market:
    - ICBC price didnt move much since the subsidiary that was hacked is a small component of the bank and not a massive player in the trasury industry 
    - Treasury failures were up the day of the hack, meaning sellers didn't send securities or buyers didnt receive them in time to repo them out. Both liquidity and volume of Treasuries are lower since the hack
    - Policy: SEC proposing that more trades cleared by DTCC. Right now $1.5T of repo is overnight and tied to Treasuries, which set SOFR. 

- Auto exports up: 
  - Boom in aouto exports contrast broader export weakness 
  - Seems to be mainly brought about by subsidiaries and US tax breaks
