summary: Using a hierarchical prior changes Bayesian models a lot more than it initially appears. Here I explore why

I was wondering what makes hierarchical models so much more flexible than non-hierarchical models, since the concept seems relatively straight foward. Also, why not just use flatter priors if we want a more flexible model? What's this secret hierarchical sauce?
May need to use a more complex dataset than just simple linear regression. I will need to find a problem where an MCMC struggles to find an appropriate solution with a single prior, but works well with a hierarchical prior.

### Hierarchical Models

In a Bayesian setting, a hierarchical model induces a "hierarchy" into the priors. All this means in practice is that what would have been a fixed parameter in a prior will now come from a distribution.
Consider a prior on some parameter, $\beta \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$. In a non-hierarchical setting, we set $\mu$ and $\sigma$ by hand, however in a hierarchical setting, we place priors on $\mu$ and/or $\sigma$. For example:

$$ \mu \sim f(\alpha) $$
$$ \sigma \sim g(\theta) $$
$$ \beta \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2) $$

So what does this give us? Why would we / should we use a hierarchical model over a non-hierarchical model?

### Why use hierarchical models?

There are a couple different settings where we'll use a hierarchical model, one of the most common is a random effects model (or mixed effects or multilevel models), where the need for hierarchy is to share data between cohorts. Read more [here](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych252/section/Mixed_models_tutorial.html).

Three main reasons why we can choose to use a hierarchical model:

1) There is some dependence in the data that isn't necessarily captured by our covariates. For example sampling people from different communities is not independent as individuals in the same community will likely be more similar than individuals across communities. This dependence changes how we consrtuct our likelihood, as the construction of the likelihood assumes data is gathered independently, which is why we can naively multiply the likelihood density. **is this data sharing?**
2) We may believe that the data itself comes from a hierarchy. For example, students. Students come from classes, which are in schools, which are in communities, etc. Modelling students across different classes can be problematic as there is dependence on the environmental context of the class.
3) Finally, we may want to use hierarchical priors to induce flexibility into the model. Although the change is subtle, it changes the posterior enough to yeild different results.

One purpose is methodological; the other is substantive. Methodologically, when units of analysis are drawn from clusters within a population (communities, neighborhoods, city blocks, etc.), they can no longer be considered independent. Individuals who come from the same cluster will be more similar to each other than they will be to individuals from other clusters. Therefore, unobserved variables may induce statistical dependence between observations within clusters that may be uncaptured by covariates within the model, violating a key assumption of maximum likelihood estimation as it is typically conducted when independence of errors is assumed. Recall that a likelihood function, when observations are independent, is simply the product of the density functions for each observation taken over all the observations. However, when independence does not hold, we cannot construct the likelihood as simply. Thus, one reason for constructing hierarchical models is to compensate for the biases—largely in the standard errors—that are introduced when the independence assumption is violated.

In addition to the methodological need for hierarchical models, substantively we may believe that there are differences in how predictors in a regression model influence an outcome of interest across clusters, and we may wish to model these differences. In other words, the influence of predictors may
be context-dependent, a notion that is extremely important and relevant to a social scientific understanding of the world. For example, the emergence of hierarchical modeling in education research occurred because there is a natural nesting of students within classes and classes within schools, schools within communities, and so on, and grades, test performance,
etc. may be dependent on teacher quality, making students in one class different from those in another class. In other words, student performance may be dependent on the teacher—the environmental context of classes.

### Open Questions
- Hierarchical priors make the model more flexible. Why can't we just use a flat prior for added flexibility?
- Specifically in the case of Normal-InverseChiSquared, the resulting posterior distribution is t-distributed, which has heavier tails than just a Normal. How will using a Normal-InverseChiSquared hierarchical prior compare to using a non-hierachical prior with fat tails? What if we just use a t-distributed prior? For this maybe we can try the 8 schools model with a prior with fat tails?
- I want to compare these 3 prior specs on an appropriate problem. Appropriate meaning not too simple:
  - Normal prior
  - Flat prior, to try to induce flexibility without hierarchy
  - Hierarchical prior
- In addition to the added flexibility, hierarchical models also help with data pooling. For example in 8 schools.

The $t_{\nu}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ distribution can be represented with a Gaussian with mean $\mu$ and variance term distributed as an Inverse-$\chi^2$ with $\nu$ degrees of freedom
