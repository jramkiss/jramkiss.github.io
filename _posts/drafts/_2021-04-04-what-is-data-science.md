I recently read an amazing article on [learning adjacent skills](http://www.effectiveengineer.com/blog/master-adjacent-disciplines), which made me second guess my quest to become a "good" data scientist. The article talks about advantages of learning adjacent skills from an engineering perspective: 

> If youâ€™re a product engineer, adjacent disciplines might include user interface design, user research, server development, or automated testing. For an infrastructure engineer, they might include database internals, basic web development, or machine learning.

With this in mind, I would imagine adjacent skills to data science would be data engineering and machine learning engineering. What about within data science? What are the adjacent skills for data scientists? 

These questions prompted me to take a step back and think about what a data scientist is, and the skills that would make a great data scientist. 

### What is a Data Scientist?

I think of a data scientist as someone who solves problems with data. If you've done this, congrats, you're a data scientist (not joking, but sort of joking). These problems could be anything, from "what is the effect of two 5 second ads versus one 10 second ad?" to "what are the most similar songs to this song?". 

An experienced data scientist will take the time to understand the underlying problem they are solving. This usually means answering general questions using the data, such as "how many users spend more than 1 hour per week on our site?". This is where technical skills start to merge with softer problem solving skills. Answering these questions require a certain level of proficiency in Spark/SQL/data querying frameworks. The more familiar these frameworks are is the more brain power that can be spent on ansering pertenant questions as opposed to thinking about syntax. 

Following the answers to these questions is the brainstorming of potential solutions to the problem. Niche problems warrant niche skillsets. 

Unfortunately, using machine learning to solve data problems is glorified these days, which brings a host of problems.
