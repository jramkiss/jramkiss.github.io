## The Art Model Development

In school I would frequently get aggitated that I don't know what the best way to approach a dataset was, I didn't really have a systematic way of choosing and experimenting with models, and much more. I quickly learnt that this is not a science, but more of an art. Knowing what to look for in a dataset is not only immensely problem dependent, but also takes time. So does getting familiar with a modelling problem, and its constraints. Sure, you may know some tools, but in the beginning you have no way of really knowing how to use them. 


## Just build a baseline

This is one of the most important things I learnt in an actual job as opposed to school. For me, school was a time where I get to learn about cool, complicated models, with no real notion of their practicality. Additionally, spending time to build a model that you **know** (read: think) is going to perform poorly seems like a complete waste of time. Why would I spend time building this when I'm just going to have to do it over? Just do it. It is likely that instead of wasting time, you end up thinking more about the problem and its constraints, as opposed to trying to use the "best" (by some arbitrary measure) model, for your problem.
