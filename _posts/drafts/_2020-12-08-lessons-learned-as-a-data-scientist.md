summary: A compilation of lessons learned in my first 3 years as a data scientist

A compilation of lessons learned in my first couple years as a data scientist. Many of these were mistakes I made and some are mistakes I've seen other data scientists make.



### Please build a baseline

This is one of the most important things I learnt in an actual job as opposed to school. For me, school was a time where I get to learn about cool, complicated models, with no real notion of their practicality. Additionally, spending time to build a model that you **know** (read: think) is going to perform poorly seems like a complete waste of time. Why would I spend time building this when I'm just going to have to do it over? Just do it. It is likely that instead of wasting time, you end up thinking more about the problem and its constraints, as opposed to trying to use the "best" (by some arbitrary measure) model, for your problem. 


### Talk to experts

Data scientists are (should be?) experts at building models, but models are nothing without end users. In this sense, 


### Machine learning is glorified




### Checklist of what not to do 

I've come across some questonable decisions made by data scientists over the years, and here are some of them. I'm guilty of nearly every single one of these!

- **Machine learning first**: This is the token exmaple of "what not to do as a data scientist" and even though it's so well publicized it still happens. I guess combination of management wanting AI/ML solutions and some managers wanting better branding for their team is deadly? 

- **Jumping to complex models too quickly**: Imagine learning how to walk by first trying to run. Although the goal is to run, we first have to figure out how our legs work. This is the same for solving data problems. Time spent playing with simple models give you a better idea of both the data and the problem that will be invaluable in the latter stages of the project. Simple doesn't always mean linear regression, it means don't overthink the modelling phase too early. I've taken this (wrong) approach in different aspects of my life, from sports to academics. Nearly every time, I only realize my mistake when it's too late and time is no longer on my side. 

- **Ten steps at a time**: 


### The Art Model Development

In school I would frequently get aggitated that I don't know what the best way to approach a dataset was, I didn't really have a systematic way of choosing and experimenting with models, and much more. I quickly learnt that this is not a science, but more of an art. Knowing what to look for in a dataset is not only problem dependent, but also takes time. So does getting familiar with a modelling problem, and its constraints. Sure, you may know some tools, but in the beginning you have no way of really knowing how to use them.
