summary: A post for anyone who doesn't understand kernels in machine learning
---

I remember learning about kernels for the first time and thinking about how daunting they were. At the time, I heard it in a couple different areas of machine learning, none of which I was particularly comfortable with. Now, some years later, I'm beginning to realize how powerful and beautiful kernels are. In this post I attempt to explain kernels using different examples like Gaussian processes and support vector machines. 

## Kernels as Covariance Matrices 

Multivariate Gaussians are parameterized by a mean vector and a covariance matrix.
