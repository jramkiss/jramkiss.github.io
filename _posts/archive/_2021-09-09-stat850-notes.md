### Order Statistics

For iid continuous RVs, $X_i \sim f(x)$ and cdf $F(x)$, let:

$$ X_{(1)} < X_{(2)} < X_{(3)} < ... < X_{(n)} $$

What is the pdf of $X_{(j)}, f(x_{(j)})$?

Start with the definition of the cdf: 

$$ f_{(j)}(x) = \frac{d}{dx}F_{(j)}(x) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{F_{(j)}(x + \Delta x) - F_{(j)}(x)}{\Delta x} $$

Now we're iterested in finding this limit, so we'll start with the numerator:

$$ F_{(j)}(x + \Delta x) - F_{(j)}(x) = p(X_j \le  x + \Delta x) - p(X_j \le x) $$

$$ = p(x \le X_j \le x + \Delta x) $$

Since $(j-1)$ X's need to be smaller than $X_j$, and $n-j$ X's need to be larger than $X_j$, this is equal to the probability that $j-1$ $X_i$'s are less than $x$, exactly 1 $X_i$ is between $x$ and $x + \Delta x$ and $(n-j)$ $X_i$'s are greater than $x + \Delta x$.
