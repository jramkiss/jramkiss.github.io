### Work

I'm currently a data scientist at [DRW](https://drw.com/) on the machine learning team. I did my undergrad and masters in statistics at the University of Waterloo and worked at [Scribd](https://www.scribd.com) in Toronto for 3 years in-between. My general interests lie somewhere in the intersection of Bayesian statistics and machine learning. I use this blog as a way learn new material or as a refresher for when I inevitably forget details about different methods.


### Play

I was a competitive swimmer for 12 years and competed internationally for Trinidad and at university. I've recently picked up tennis, which has proven to be **a lot** harder than it looks on Youtube.
