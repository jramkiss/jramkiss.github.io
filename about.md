### Work

I am currently a data scientist at [Scribd](https://www.scribd.com) on the Applied Research team in Toronto. I'm mainly interested in modelling problems with Bayesian statistics. I also enjoy other problems in deep learning, which is what my day job is centered around.


### Play

I was a competitive [swimmer](https://www.swimrankings.net/index.php?page=athleteDetail&athleteId=4849767) for 12 years and still enjoy recreational swimming. I've recently picked up tennis, which has proven to be **a lot** harder than it looks on Youtube.
