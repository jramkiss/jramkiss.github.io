### Work

I am currently a data scientist at [Scribd](https://www.scribd.com) on the Applied Research team in Toronto. Before that I did my undergrad in statistics at the University of Waterloo. I'm mainly interested in the intersection of Bayesian statistics and machine learning. 


### Play

I was a competitive swimmer for 12 years and competed internationally for Trinidad and at university. I've recently picked up tennis, which has proven to be **a lot** harder than it looks on Youtube.
