### Work

I'm a masters student in statistics at the University of Waterloo and was a data scientist at [Scribd](https://www.scribd.com) before that. My general interest lie somewhere in the intersection of Bayesian statistics and machine learning. This blog is a somewhat random assortment of things I find interesting or experiments I find cool. 


### Play

I was a competitive swimmer for 12 years and competed internationally for Trinidad and at university. I've recently picked up tennis, which has proven to be **a lot** harder than it looks on Youtube.
